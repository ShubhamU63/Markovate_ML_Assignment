##  Drift Monitoring Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Logging**
   - Continuously log model inputs, predictions, and ground truth (when available).
   - Store data with timestamps for temporal analysis.

2. **Baseline Definition**
   - Define a **reference dataset** (e.g., training or validation data).
   - Calculate baseline statistics for all key features and model metrics.

3. **Drift Detection**
   - Compare new incoming data against baseline using:
     - **Statistical Tests** (e.g., KS Test, Chi-square)
     - **Population Stability Index (PSI)**
     - **Wasserstein Distance**
   - Monitor both **input drift** and **prediction drift**.

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Track metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision/recall, AUC.
   - Alert if metrics drop beyond a defined threshold (e.g., >5% decline).

5. **Automated Alerting**
   - Integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, EvidentlyAI).
   - Trigger notifications via email/Slack when drift exceeds thresholds.

6. **Drift Investigation**
   - Identify which features contribute most to drift.
   - Check for upstream data pipeline issues or changes in user behavior.

7. **Mitigation**
   - Retrain model with latest data.
   - Use incremental learning or fine-tuning if full retraining is costly.
   - Validate retrained model before deployment.

##  Metrics and Thresholds

| Category | Metric | Threshold | Action |
|-----------|---------|------------|--------|
| **Data Drift** | PSI | > 0.2 | Trigger drift alert |
| **Model Performance** | Accuracy drop | > 5% from baseline | Retraining candidate |
| **Prediction Drift** | KL Divergence | > 0.1 | Investigate feature changes |

## üîÅ Retraining Strategy

| Strategy | Description | When to Use |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Scheduled Retraining** | Retrain periodically (e.g., weekly/monthly) | Stable environments |
| **Performance-based Retraining** | Retrain only when performance drops | Cost-efficient setups |
| **Continuous Learning** | Incrementally update model on new data | Streaming or fast-changing data |
